BitHop is a mod to add simple, lag-free hopper alternatives. They don't pull from inventories or pick up items from the ground, so they're perfect for making long hopper chains while still staying in an easy, vanilla style!

Now included are the PullHop (pulls items from chests while skipping intensive entity checks), the FluxHop (transfers RF as well as items), and the ScrewHop (transfers items up and forward).
